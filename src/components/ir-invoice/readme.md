| `invoiceOpen`    | Emitted when the invoice drawer is opened.  Fired when `openDrawer()` is called and the component transitions into the open state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `CustomEvent<void>`                                                                                                                               |


## Methods

### `closeDrawer() => Promise<void>`

Closes the invoice drawer.

This method sets the `open` property to `false`, hiding the drawer.
Parent components can call this to close the drawer programmatically,
and it is also used internally when the drawer emits `onDrawerHide`.

Also emits the `invoiceClose` event.

#### Returns

Type: `Promise<void>`

Resolves once the drawer state is updated.

### `openDrawer() => Promise<void>`

Opens the invoice drawer.

This method sets the `open` property to `true`, making the drawer visible.
It can be called programmatically by parent components.

Also emits the `invoiceOpen` event.

#### Returns

Type: `Promise<void>`

Resolves once the drawer state is updated.
